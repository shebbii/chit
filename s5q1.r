# Q1. Write a R program to concatenate two given factors.

# Define two factors
factor1 <- factor(c("A", "B", "C", "D"))
factor2 <- factor(c("E", "F", "G", "H"))

# Concatenate the two factors
concatenated_factor <- c(factor1, factor2)

# Print the concatenated factor
print(concatenated_factor)
