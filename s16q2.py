# Q2. Write a Python program build Decision Tree Classifier using Scikit-learnpackage for 
# diabetes data set (download database from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indiansdiabetes-database)

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the dataset from the CSV file
data = pd.read_csv("diabetes.csv")

# Define features (X) and the target variable (y)
X = data.drop('Outcome', axis=1)
y = data['Outcome']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a Decision Tree Classifier
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()

# Fit the classifier to the training data
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the accuracy of the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
